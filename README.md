# Howdy!

I look forward to a long and productive working relationship with you. To hopefully accelerate the process, this document is meant to give you some idea of how I operate and my personal values.

**My role is to make Engineering successful.** What that requires changes frequently. Regardless, my underlying mission is to make our people and practices ever stronger and more capable of thriving in our fast-paced business.  

**I care about the small things.** Well-written code, pixel alignment, a groomed backlog, useful system logs.... I believe a strong, professional, software engineering team does everything well. Let's be proud of the external and internal quality.

**We need to be very focused.** I believe in applying the Kanban approach of minimizing WIP at all levels (company, team, individual). We need to be highly selective about projects / tasks we undertake, and work to complete them ASAP.

**I like to debate ideas.** But just because I argue against something, doesn't mean I'm against it. I often play devil's advocate. Chewing through an idea is my way of testing and understanding it.

**I'm obsessed with getting feedback quickly.** Whether it's introducing a new feature, or change to the organization, I always look for ways to get user feedback and eliminate major risks ASAP. 
When it comes to people, I aim to provide honest, timely views on performance. I hope you'll do the same with me.

**I may message/email you late at night or on weekends.** I do not expect a response outside normal business hours. If there is something urgent I will call you instead.
Feel free to message me at anytime.

**I try to have faith in people, process and projects.** Healthy skepticism is fine, but I can't stand cynicism (although I'm guilty of it occasionally). When we decide to do something, when we decide to work with people, we must have total commitment to a positive outcome.

**I do my best to be clear and honest.** If I can't provide a straight answer, for reasons such as insufficient information or ethical obligations, I will state as such. If you sense me indirectly avoiding difficult questions, or bs'ing in general, feel free to call me out on it (I'll do the same with you).

**Books that have shaped my thinking**

* "Clean Code" and "Clean Coder" by Robert Martin
* "Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests" by Steve Freeman, Nat Pryce
* "Drive" by Daniel Pink
